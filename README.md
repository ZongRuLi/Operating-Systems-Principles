# Operating Systems Principles

## PA 0: Getting Acquainted with XINU
pass all

## PA 1: Process Scheduling
pass all test cases

## PA 2: Readers/Writer Locks with Priority Inheritance
pass all test cases

## PA 3: Demand Paging
pass all test cases<br><br>
Note: fail at test 8 (LFU frame replacement policy). However, TA checks my source code and decide to let me pass test 8.
I don't know why TA test LFU in test 8, it is apparently not FIFO(at least not the FIFO policy in the project 3 spec).
